Kohn Sham Test Cases


ISSUE: The kinetic energy blows up during the iterations.  

1. Testing the Orbital Part
Suppressed Vxc and Vcoulomb, reducing to single electron Schrodinger

	—PASS— Single atom at origin, ground state orbital computed accurately
		Implication: Helmholtz part still good, orbital KE and PE still good for a grid with all cubes

	—PASS— Single atom off-center (-1.5,1.5,1.5), ground state orbital computed accurately
		Implication: Orbital energies computed accurately for non-cubic cells
	
	—FAIL— Two atoms, coaxial along x-axis.  Kinetic blows up
		Implication: Something wrong with orbitals for two atom grid
		Probe this with further tests:

		—PASS— Tighter aspect ratios: 1.5 -> 1.2.  Kinetic still blows up
			Implication: aspect ratio of 1.5 seems to be fine.

		—PASS— Two atoms, not coaxial.  Gives same result as coaxial
			Implication: The problem is not that the atoms are coaxial

		—XXXX— Test the initialization divides (due to subsequent atoms and aspect ratio)
			FOUND BUG: Aspect ratio divides weren’t getting both of the y children.  



2. Testing the Potential Part
In isolation, compute the Coulomb potential from a known density
	—PASS— Computing potential from Krasny’s ``pseudo potential’’ and Gaussian potential
		Implication: Coulomb convolution is working.  Accuracy TBD, but it gets a few digits in L2error.
