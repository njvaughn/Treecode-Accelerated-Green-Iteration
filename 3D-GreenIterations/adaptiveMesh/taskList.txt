Green Iterations AMR Task List


Excited States
—Test normalization of analytic wavefunction— check my scaling factor
—Test orthogonalization
—Why the L2 error in the excited wavefunction — solved… psi only defined to a minus sign, was converging to the negative of the analytic solution I provided
—Plot slices along face


Other
—Extract only midpoints and face centers
—Parameter study for ground state, also for excited state
—Perform all of Green Iterations on GPU.  Extract leaves ONCE, along with cell volumes.  Will require communicating the updated target values to the array of sources, which could be tricky.
—Extrapolate between children and parents



test case
r = 0.5694020987
psi200 = (2-r)e^(-r/2) / (4sqrt(2pi)) = 0.1073306015
